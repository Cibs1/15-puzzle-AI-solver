# 15-puzzle-AI-solver
A conglomerate of AI algorythms to find the solution to any 15 puzzle configuration within milliseconds.

To try this out you're gonna want to download the files then open the input.txt file and put whatever configuration of the 15 puzzle you want to solve, then run "jogo-dos-15.java" and it should tell you to choose with which AI algorythm you want the configuration to be solved with, works entirely on your terminal.
